## Severity Levels
| Level | Description | Visual Indicator |
|-------|-------------|------------------|

| Low | Minor concerns | üü¢ |
| Clean | No issues detected | ‚úÖ |

## Best Practices
1. **Issue Resolution**
   - Address high-severity issues immediately
   - Document any false positives
   - Implement security controls

2. **Scan Configuration**
   - Run scans pre-commit
   - Configure custom rules
   - Maintain allowlists for approved patterns

3. **Reporting**
   - Export results in JSON/CSV
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
   - Track issue trends over time

## Notes
- Results should be reviewed by security teams
- False positives should be documented
- Regular scans recommended
